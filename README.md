# Assembler
This is a project for the Caltech 150 class. This assembler is designed for the PIC16 family of chips.

## FEATURES TO BE IMPLEMENTED (TODO)
- memory access (pic is weird so it will have to be for another iteration)
- .org
- configs
- end and goto $
- super stress testing
- fix private-public members
- see if you can refactor the messageing and error system for translator
- See how many includes you can get rid of
