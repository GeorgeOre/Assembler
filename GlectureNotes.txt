NEED TO DO DETAILED DESIGN
	- Needs to be detailed enough to make implementation easy
	- You don’t want to be thinking about the design during implementation
	
	
When you add enumerated types, you MUST specify the values!!

C++ Object Lifecycle
	- Create
		○ Constructor
			§ Automatic
			§ Default constructor
				□ No arguments
				□ Always exists unless YOU make another constructor
				□ System default constructor
					® Sets things to null
					® If static sets to random memory value
				□ Ex:
					® myObject o;
			§ Copy Constructor
				□ By default is a shallow copy
				□ Takes each data member and copies it
				□ Ex:
					® myObject o;
					® myObject 02 = 2 o;
				□ Does not work with dynamic memory allocation
					® Using the new keyword
	- Manipulate
		○ Methods, accessors, mutators
	- Destruct
		○ Automatic
		○ Default destructor
			§ Removes the data members from memory
			§ Does not work for dynamic memory allocation
		○ *** YOU NEED A VIRTUAL DESTRUCTOR TO MAINTAIN POLYMORPHISM
			§ Ex:
				□ Base *b;
				□ Child *c;
				□ b=c;
				□ b->method();
					® If not virtual
						◊ b::method
					® If virtual
						◊ c::method

EXAMPLE:
	- Line object
		○ Operand list member
			§ Index OP
			§ Value OP
			§ String OP
		○ HOW WILL YOU HANDLE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES
		○ LINE # (IN THE FILE)
		○ FILE STRING
			§ Which file you are in and what line number of the string you 

SWITCH STATEMENTS ARE NOT OBJECT ORIENTED!!
	- You should want to 
	
	
OP Codes
	- Instruction op code
		○ Index opcodes
		○ Value opcodes
		○ No operand opcode
	- Specific psudo op 1 code
	- Specific psudo op 2 code
	- Specific psudo op 3 code
	- So on
	- Memory space pseudo op
		○ Data
		○ Text
		○ Info
		○ It is structured very similarly but a with maybe a different function pointer
		
		
		
WHAT DOES INCLUDE DO??
	- MAKE LINE NUMBER IN YOUR FILE DIFFERENT FROM THE PROGRAM COUNTER'S NUMBER
		○ Line number in file
			§ References are used only for error file generation
		○ Line number the program memory/counter space
			§ 


NOLIST/LIST
	- DO you wanna list this in the pc space
